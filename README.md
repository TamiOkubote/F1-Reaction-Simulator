# F1-Reaction-Simulator
In this application, I created a simulator based off the reaction exercise that F1 drivers pratcise in real time, to improve their reactions on the track!

Here, I've programmed using the coding languages Javascript (and a bit of HTML and CSS fitted in there!) to create and appliation with an interactive GUI.

The simulator involves multiple screens to back in and out of, and a timer once the gameplay commences. Here you'll have 30 seconds to click as much targets as you can, which will be recorded as your score (Psst, you can beat your score, to create a HIGH SCORE that will end till the end of time!

You also get to choose the difficulty of each level. Easy, too easy? Then switch to modes 'intermediate' and 'difficult' if you want more targets, at an even smaller size.
